A **currency strength meter strategy** should do one job well:

> Help you spend more time on strong-vs-weak environments and less time on random range markets.

On LiveForexStrength, you can apply the strategy directly on the live tool:

- [Dashboard](/)
- [Forex heatmap](/heatmap)

## The core idea: separate bias from timing

Most traders get whipsawed because they trade one timeframe.

Instead:

- **Bias timeframe** = who is strong/weak in the current leg
- **Timing timeframe** = when to enter after pullbacks or consolidation

## Step-by-step workflow

### 1) Set bias on 4h or 12h

Start here:

- [Dashboard (4h)](/?tf=4h)
- [Dashboard (12h)](/?tf=12h)

Write down:

- top 2–3 currencies
- bottom 2–3 currencies

### 2) Build pair ideas (top vs bottom)

Combine strong vs weak into a shortlist:

- strong USD + weak JPY → watch **USDJPY**
- strong EUR + weak CHF → watch **EURCHF**

### 3) Check context on 1h

Use 1h to avoid timing entries into the middle of session transitions:

- [Dashboard (1h)](/?tf=1h)

### 4) Time entries on 15m (or 30m)

Use a lower timeframe for timing:

- [Dashboard (15m)](/?tf=15m)
- [Dashboard (30m)](/?tf=30m)

Look for:

- pullback ending while rankings remain aligned
- breakout from a tight range with alignment still present

### 5) Confirm momentum/volatility with the heatmap

If the idea is “correct” but the pair isn’t moving, skip it.

Use:

- [Forex heatmap](/heatmap)

## The two filters that prevent most bad trades

### Filter A — “spread” must be meaningful

If the basket is compressed (top and bottom close together), strength is usually noisy.

### Filter B — avoid “middle vs middle”

Currencies near the middle flip too frequently. Prefer top vs bottom combinations first.
