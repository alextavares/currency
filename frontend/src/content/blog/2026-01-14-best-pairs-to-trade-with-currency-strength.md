When people search for the **best pairs to trade with currency strength**, they usually want a shortcut.

The truth: the “best pair” changes with market conditions. What you want is a **method** that keeps producing high-quality candidates.

Use the tool:

- [Dashboard](/)
- [Heatmap](/heatmap)

## The shortlist method (top vs bottom)

1) Pick a bias timeframe (4h/12h/1W)  
2) Note top 2–3 and bottom 2–3 currencies  
3) Combine top vs bottom into watchlist pairs  

Guide: [Strong vs weak currency pairs](/blog/2026-01-13-strong-vs-weak-currency-pairs).

## “Good default” pairs to watch (majors + key crosses)

These tend to be liquid and widely followed:

- EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, USDCAD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD
- EURJPY, GBPJPY, AUDJPY, CADJPY
- EURGBP, AUDNZD

If you want context and links:

- [Browse pairs](/pairs)

## How to choose the direction (base vs quote)

Rule:

- Buy strong currency / sell weak currency

If a pair is quoted opposite to the direction you want, you trade the inverse (same idea).

## Confirm movement before committing

Even a great pair idea is not tradeable if it’s not moving.

Use:

- [Forex heatmap explained](/blog/2026-01-13-forex-heatmap-explained)
- [Heatmap tool](/heatmap)

## A realistic “best pairs” checklist

- The pair’s currencies are top vs bottom (not both neutral)
- Timeframes agree (bias + timing)
- Heatmap confirms movement
- Structure is clean (trend + pullback)

## Next step
