If you’ve ever looked at a currency strength meter and thought “Is 72 a buy?”, you’re not alone — and that question is exactly why people misuse strength dashboards.

On **LiveForexStrength**, each currency gets a score between **0 and 100** for the selected timeframe. The score is a **relative ranking** inside the basket of 8 majors.

Open the dashboard here: [Dashboard](/).

## The simplest interpretation: it’s a ranking

Think of it like a league table:

- **100** = strongest in the basket
- **0** = weakest in the basket
- **50** = “middle of the pack”

It does **not** mean “overbought/oversold”. It means “stronger/weaker than the others” in the same timeframe.

## What matters more than the number: the spread

Two dashboards can look similar but behave very differently:

- Case A: top = 55, bottom = 45 → very tight spread → usually chop / low conviction
- Case B: top = 90, bottom = 10 → wide spread → strong directional environment

So instead of obsessing over one currency’s number, look at:

- **Top vs bottom distance**
- Whether the top and bottom stay stable over time

## A practical “traffic light” guide

There’s no universal threshold, but this tends to work as a quick heuristic:

- **65–100**: strong (upper half, strong trend candidates)
- **35–65**: neutral (often range / mixed signals)
- **0–35**: weak (lower half, weak trend candidates)

The biggest value is when a currency stays strong/weak across multiple timeframes.

## Use multiple timeframes (bias → timing)

Here’s a simple way to avoid getting whipsawed:

- Use [1W](/timeframes/1w) or [12h](/timeframes/12h) to define bias
- Use [4h](/timeframes/4h) and [1h](/timeframes/1h) for structure/context
- Use [15m](/timeframes/15m) or [5m](/timeframes/5m) for timing

Example:

- 1W: USD strong, JPY weak
- 4h: USD still strong, JPY still weak
- 15m: pullback finishes and strength alignment returns → better timing window

You can open the dashboard at a specific timeframe:

- [Dashboard (1W)](/?tf=1w)
- [Dashboard (4h)](/?tf=4h)
- [Dashboard (15m)](/?tf=15m)

## The “middle currencies” problem

Currencies in the middle (around 40–60) often flip ranks frequently. Trading them against each other tends to create:

- fake breakouts
- mean reversion
- low-quality trends

Strength trading usually works best when you pair **top vs bottom**.

## What to do when the score flips quickly

Quick flips can happen because:

- the market is transitioning (session change, news)
- the timeframe is too low for current volatility
- the basket is compressed (no trend)

When that happens, zoom out:

- If 5m is messy, check [30m](/timeframes/30m) and [1h](/timeframes/1h)
- If everything is messy, check [4h](/timeframes/4h) and [12h](/timeframes/12h)

## Next step: turn score into pair selection

If you understand the score, the next move is selecting pairs:
