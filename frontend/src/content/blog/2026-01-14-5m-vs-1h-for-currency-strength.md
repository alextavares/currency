If you’re comparing **5m vs 1h for currency strength**, you’re really deciding between:

- speed (5m)
- stability (1h)

Use the tool:

- [Dashboard](/)
- [Timeframes](/timeframes)

## What 5m is good for

5m is best for:

- fine entry timing after a pullback
- quick confirmation when the market is already trending

But 5m flips easily during quiet conditions.

Open:

- [Dashboard (5m)](/?tf=5m)

## What 1h is good for

1h is best for:

- context (session structure)
- cleaner bias shifts than 5m
- avoiding overreacting to noise

Open:

- [Dashboard (1h)](/?tf=1h)

## A practical combo

Use:

- 4h/12h as bias
- 1h as context
- 5m or 15m as timing (depending on volatility)

If 5m is chaotic, use 15m.

## Confirm movers

Before you commit:

- confirm movement on the heatmap:
