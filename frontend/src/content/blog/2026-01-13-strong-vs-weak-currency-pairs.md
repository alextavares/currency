Searching for **strong vs weak currency pairs** usually means you want one thing:

> A short list of pairs that have a cleaner directional bias than random “middle vs middle” trades.

The best way to build that list is not memorizing pairs — it’s using a repeatable filter.

Open the live strength rankings: [Dashboard](/).

## Step 1 — Pick your bias timeframe

Start from a higher timeframe so you’re not reacting to noise:

- Swing/intraday bias: [4h](/timeframes/4h) or [12h](/timeframes/12h)
- Macro bias: [1W](/timeframes/1w)

Quick links:

- [Dashboard (4h)](/?tf=4h)
- [Dashboard (12h)](/?tf=12h)
- [Dashboard (1W)](/?tf=1w)

## Step 2 — Write down extremes (top and bottom)

On your bias timeframe:

- take the **top 2–3 currencies**
- take the **bottom 2–3 currencies**

Ignore the middle for now. “Middle currencies” flip constantly and create low-quality signals.

## Step 3 — Combine top vs bottom into tradeable pairs

Now create pair ideas by combining strong vs weak:

- Strong USD vs weak JPY → **USDJPY**
- Strong CHF vs weak AUD → **AUDCHF** (sell AUD / buy CHF)
- Strong GBP vs weak EUR → **EURGBP** (often traded in the “weak vs strong” quote direction)

If you want context for each pair:

- [Browse pairs](/pairs)
- Example: [EURUSD](/pairs/eurusd)

## Step 4 — Time entries on a lower timeframe

Once you have a watchlist, use a lower timeframe for timing:

- [15m](/timeframes/15m) or [30m](/timeframes/30m)

Example flow:

1) 4h says USD strong / JPY weak (bias)
2) 15m shows a pullback finishing + alignment returning (timing)

## Step 5 — Confirm the move is actually happening (heatmap)

Strength tells you who’s strong/weak. The heatmap confirms which pairs are moving:

- [Forex heatmap](/heatmap)

This prevents the classic mistake of picking a “correct” pair idea in a market that isn’t moving.

## Common traps

- **Top vs middle**: strong currency vs a neutral currency often stalls.
- **No spread**: if the top/bottom are close together, it’s usually chop.
- **Timeframe mismatch**: if 1W says strong but 5m says weak, you might be looking at a pullback.
