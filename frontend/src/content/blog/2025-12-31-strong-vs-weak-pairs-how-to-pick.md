The fastest way to improve your FX pair selection is to stop treating every pair as equal.

Most clean moves come from pairing a **strong currency** with a **weak currency** — and avoiding “middle vs middle” noise.

Open the live dashboard here: [Dashboard](/).

## Step 1 — Identify the top and bottom currencies

On the selected timeframe, write down:

- Top 2–3 strongest currencies
- Bottom 2–3 weakest currencies

LiveForexStrength already sorts the currencies by strength. Focus on the extremes.

## Step 2 — Create a shortlist of pairs (top vs bottom)

Combine top currencies against bottom currencies:

- If **USD strong** and **JPY weak** → consider **USDJPY**
- If **GBP strong** and **EUR weak** → consider **GBPEUR** (often traded as EURGBP in reverse)
- If **CHF strong** and **AUD weak** → consider **CHFAUD** (often traded as AUDCHF in reverse)

The exact traded symbol depends on the broker’s quoting convention, but the idea stays the same:

> Buy the strong currency / sell the weak currency.

You can review each currency’s typical behavior here: [Currencies](/currencies).

## Step 3 — Confirm higher timeframe alignment (the “stacking” rule)

Strength is most useful when it **stacks**:

- 1W bias agrees with 4h bias
- 4h agrees with 1h
- 1h agrees with 15m (or at least doesn’t contradict it)

Use the timeframes guide as a reference:

- [Timeframes](/timeframes)

Quick pattern:

- **1W/12h/4h** = bias
- **1h** = context
- **15m/5m** = timing

## Step 4 — Avoid the “middle trap”

If both currencies are near the middle, price often ranges.

Instead of trading:

- EUR (52) vs GBP (48)  → low conviction

Prefer:

- AUD (88) vs JPY (12) → higher conviction environment

It’s not about predicting the future — it’s about filtering for where **directional imbalance** exists.

## Step 5 — Use structure, not just strength

After you have a strong-vs-weak idea, confirm with price structure:

- trend + pullback + continuation
- breakout from a tight range *with* strength alignment
- higher highs/higher lows (or lower highs/lower lows)

Strength tells you **what** to watch. Structure tells you **when** it’s actionable.

## A simple example workflow

1) Open [Dashboard (4h)](/?tf=4h) and note top/bottom
2) Switch to [Dashboard (15m)](/?tf=15m) and check if the same currencies remain strong/weak
3) If 15m is choppy, switch to [30m](/?tf=30m) and [1h](/?tf=1h) for cleaner context

## Bonus: “Pairs to avoid” list

Even with good rankings, some pairs can be messy depending on your style:

- Pairs that are historically choppy in your session
- Pairs with wide spreads at your broker
- Pairs that are stuck in a long-term range

Use the meter to **reduce** your universe, not to force a trade.

## Next step

Now that you can generate pair ideas, the next improvement is choosing the right timeframe combo:
