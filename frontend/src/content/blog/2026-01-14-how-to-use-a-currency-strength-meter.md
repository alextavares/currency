If you’re searching **how to use a currency strength meter**, you probably want a repeatable process — not another indicator screenshot.

Here’s a simple checklist you can apply with LiveForexStrength:

- Live rankings: [Dashboard](/)
- Movers confirmation: [Heatmap](/heatmap)

## Step 1 — Choose your timeframe job (bias vs timing)

Start with roles:

- **4h / 12h / 1W** = bias (directional backdrop)
- **15m / 30m** = timing (entries after pullbacks)

Timeframes guide: [Timeframes](/timeframes).

Quick links:

- [Dashboard (4h)](/?tf=4h)
- [Dashboard (15m)](/?tf=15m)

## Step 2 — Write down extremes (top/bottom)

On your bias timeframe:

- top 2–3 currencies
- bottom 2–3 currencies

Ignore the middle for now.

## Step 3 — Build pair ideas (strong vs weak)

Combine top vs bottom into a shortlist:

- strong USD + weak JPY → watch USDJPY
- strong CHF + weak AUD → watch AUDCHF (sell AUD / buy CHF)

Guide: [Strong vs weak currency pairs](/blog/2026-01-13-strong-vs-weak-currency-pairs).

Pairs library:

- [Browse pairs](/pairs)

## Step 4 — Confirm the pair is actually moving (heatmap)

Even “correct” pair ideas can be dead.

Use the heatmap to confirm movement across timeframes:

- [Forex heatmap](/heatmap)

## Step 5 — Time entries on 15m/30m (structure + alignment)

Strength is not a trigger. Use price structure:

- pullback + continuation
- breakout from consolidation (with alignment still present)

If 15m is noisy, switch to 30m.

## Step 6 — Sanity checks (avoid the bad environments)

Stand aside when:

- the basket is compressed (small top/bottom spread)
- timeframes disagree hard (constant flips)
