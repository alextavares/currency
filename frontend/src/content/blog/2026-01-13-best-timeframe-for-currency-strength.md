If you’re asking for the **best timeframe for currency strength**, you’re usually trying to avoid two problems:

1) reacting to noise on low timeframes  
2) being too slow on high timeframes

The fix is simple:

> Use one timeframe for bias and another for timing.

Open the tool: [Dashboard](/).

## A practical “job list” for each timeframe

Use this as a default:

- **1W / 12h / 4h** → bias (directional backdrop)
- **1h** → context (structure + sessions)
- **30m / 15m** → timing (pullbacks, consolidations)
- **5m** → fine timing (only if market conditions are clean)

Timeframes guide: [Timeframes](/timeframes).

## Best default combo for most traders: 4h + 15m

Why it works:

- 4h is slow enough to avoid random flips
- 15m is fast enough to time pullbacks without pure noise

- [Dashboard (15m)](/?tf=15m)

## When to use 12h instead of 4h

Use **12h** when:

- 4h rankings flip too often
- you’re in a choppy week and want smoother bias

- [Dashboard (12h)](/?tf=12h)

## When to use 1W

Use **1W** when:

- you want to stay aligned with macro flows
- you prefer fewer trades and fewer false starts

- [Dashboard (1W)](/?tf=1w)

## The “spread” rule (more important than timeframe)

The best timeframes still fail if the basket is compressed:

- small distance between top and bottom → often range
- big distance between top and bottom → clearer direction

## Confirm with the heatmap (don’t trade “dead” pairs)

Even with clean rankings, you want the pair to actually move:
