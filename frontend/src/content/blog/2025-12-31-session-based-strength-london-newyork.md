FX is a 24‑hour market, but it doesn’t trade with equal intensity all day. Liquidity and volatility shift as major sessions open and close — and that can change strength rankings quickly.

Live dashboard: [Dashboard](/)

## Why sessions matter for a strength meter

When a session opens:

- spreads tighten
- volume increases
- “real” directional flows appear

When a session fades:

- price can drift
- mean reversion becomes more common
- strength rankings can compress or flip

So the goal is not to “predict” a session — it’s to trade when **liquidity supports follow-through**.

## A practical setup: 1h context + 15m timing

For most traders, this is a clean way to work:

- **1h** for context: [Dashboard (1h)](/?tf=1h)
- **15m** for timing: [Dashboard (15m)](/?tf=15m)

### London open (roughly 07:00–10:00 UTC)
Common behavior:

- continuation of the Asian range break
- strong trending moves on EUR, GBP crosses

What to look for:

- a clear top/bottom ranking on 1h
- the same currencies near the extremes on 15m
- a break from consolidation *with* strength alignment

### New York open (roughly 12:00–15:00 UTC)
Common behavior:

- reversals or continuations depending on news and positioning
- strong moves in USD pairs (especially if data prints)

What to look for:

- does USD stay top/bottom on 1h?
- does the spread widen (more directional), or compress (more range)?

## The “handoff” zone: London → NY overlap

The overlap can be the most volatile part of the day. Strength can **accelerate** (trend continuation) or **snap back** (profit-taking).

One simple rule:

- If strength alignment remains stable during the overlap, continuation odds improve.
- If the top/bottom currencies swap repeatedly, avoid forcing trades.

## A simple session checklist

Before you trade:

1) Are top vs bottom currencies clear on 1h?
2) Is the spread wide enough (not all clustered around 50)?
3) Is the timing timeframe (15m/5m) aligned or at least not contradicting?
4) Is there a clear price structure (break + retest / trend + pullback)?

If “no” to any of these, wait.
