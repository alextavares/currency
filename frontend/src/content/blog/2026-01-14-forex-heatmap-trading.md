**Forex heatmap trading** is not about staring at red/green boxes until you feel confident.

It’s about confirmation:

- Strength rankings suggest “who is strong vs weak”
- Heatmap confirms “which pairs are actually moving”

Tools:

- [Dashboard](/)
- [Heatmap](/heatmap)

## Step 1 — Start from the bias timeframe

Pick one bias timeframe:

- 4h or 12h for most traders
- 1W for macro bias

Then build pair ideas:

- [Strong vs weak currency pairs](/blog/2026-01-13-strong-vs-weak-currency-pairs)

## Step 2 — Use the heatmap to filter “dead” pairs

On the heatmap:

- scan the bias column first (4h/12h)
- look for pairs that also show direction on 1h/30m

This reduces chasing short-term spikes.

## Step 3 — Switch to timing timeframe for entries

If the heatmap confirms a mover, you still need structure:

- use 15m/30m for timing
- wait for pullbacks to resolve with alignment intact

## Common mistakes

- trading heatmap spikes on 5m without higher-timeframe context
- taking signals when the basket is compressed
- ignoring session transitions
