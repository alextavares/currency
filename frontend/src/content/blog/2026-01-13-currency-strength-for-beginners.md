If you’re new to **currency strength**, this is the fastest way to understand what a strength meter is actually telling you — without turning it into a complicated indicator.

Open the live dashboard: [Dashboard](/).

## What “currency strength” means

Currencies don’t move in isolation. They only move relative to other currencies through pairs (EURUSD, GBPJPY, etc.).

So “strength” is shorthand for:

- which currencies have been outperforming the others over a timeframe
- which currencies have been underperforming

If you want the longer explanation:

- [What is a currency strength meter?](/blog/2025-12-31-what-is-a-currency-strength-meter)

## The only mental model you need: rankings

On LiveForexStrength, each currency is ranked **0–100** on a selected timeframe.

- high score = stronger than the rest (in that timeframe)
- low score = weaker than the rest

## A beginner workflow (do this every time)

1) Start on a higher timeframe: [Dashboard (4h)](/?tf=4h)  
2) Note the top 2–3 and bottom 2–3 currencies  
3) Build a pair watchlist from top vs bottom  
4) Use [15m](/?tf=15m) for timing

## The “strong vs weak” rule

Beginner mistake: trading a strong currency against a “neutral” currency.

Better: trade a strong currency against a weak currency (clear imbalance).

Here’s a full method:

## Confirm real movement with the heatmap

Even with good rankings, you want the pair to actually be moving:

- [Forex heatmap](/heatmap)

## What to do when rankings flip constantly

If 5m is chaotic:

- move up to 15m or 30m for timing
- use 12h for bias when the week is choppy
