**Currency strength** and **correlation** are often mixed up because both help with pair selection.

They answer different questions:

- Strength: who is strong vs weak (rankings by timeframe)
- Correlation: which pairs move together (or against each other)

Use:

- Strength tool: [Dashboard](/)
- Pair context: [Pairs](/pairs)

## What currency strength is best for

Strength is best for:

- filtering for strong-vs-weak environments
- avoiding random “middle vs middle” trades
- aligning bias and timing across timeframes

## What correlation is best for

Correlation is best for:

- avoiding accidental doubling of risk (two pairs moving together)
- building hedged baskets (advanced)
- spotting redundant trades

Correlation alone won’t tell you which currency is leading.

## A practical way to use both

1) Use strength to pick top vs bottom currencies.  
2) Build pair ideas and pick one main pair to focus on.  
3) Use correlation thinking to avoid adding a second pair that is effectively the same trade.

## Confirm movement

Regardless of tool, confirm that the pair is actually moving:
