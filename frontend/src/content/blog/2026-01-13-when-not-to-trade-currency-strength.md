Currency strength tools work best when markets are directional.

They work *worst* when the basket is compressed and rankings flip constantly.

Use the live tool: [Dashboard](/).

## 1) When the basket is compressed (no spread)

If the top and bottom currencies are close together, you’re often in a range environment.

Symptoms:

- several currencies hover around the middle (40–60)
- leadership changes every few minutes

Fix:

- zoom out to [4h](/timeframes/4h) or [12h](/timeframes/12h)
- wait for a wider spread before taking “strength-based” trades

## 2) When timeframes disagree hard

Example:

- 1W says USD strong
- 5m says USD weak

That’s usually:

- a pullback in a larger trend, or
- a transition (session change / news)

Fix:

- use a clear bias timeframe + a clear timing timeframe

## 3) When a “correct” idea has no movement

Sometimes the ranking suggests a clean pair idea, but price is dead.

Fix:

- confirm momentum/volatility with the heatmap:
  - [Forex heatmap](/heatmap)

## 4) When you’re trading “middle vs middle”

If both currencies are near the middle of the pack, the pair often chops.

Fix:

- prioritize top vs bottom combinations:

## Quick checklist (before taking a trade)

- Is the spread meaningful (top vs bottom)?
- Do 2–3 timeframes agree on who’s strong/weak?
- Is the pair actually moving on the heatmap?
- Is price structure aligned (trend + pullback + continuation)?
