Most strength dashboards “work”… until you trade a single timeframe and get chopped up by pullbacks.

The fix is simple:

> Use higher timeframes to define bias, and lower timeframes to time entries.

Live dashboard: [Dashboard](/)

## Combo #1 (Simple & effective): 4h bias + 15m timing

This is the default combo for many intraday swing traders:

- **4h**: tells you who’s strong/weak in the current leg  
  Open: [Dashboard (4h)](/?tf=4h)
- **15m**: helps you enter after pullbacks or consolidations  
  Open: [Dashboard (15m)](/?tf=15m)

How to use it:

1) Find top vs bottom currencies on 4h
2) Check if the same currencies are near the extremes on 15m
3) Use 15m price structure for entry timing

## Combo #2 (Session traders): 1h context + 5m timing

If you trade London/NY session moves:

- **1h**: session structure and “cleaner” intraday bias  
  Open: [Dashboard (1h)](/?tf=1h)
- **5m**: timing and micro pullbacks  
  Open: [Dashboard (5m)](/?tf=5m)

Rule of thumb:

- If 5m is too noisy, move timing to 15m.

## Combo #3 (Macro to micro): 1W bias + 4h execution

If you want to stay aligned with the biggest flows:

- **1W**: dominant bias and broad strength leadership  
  Open: [Dashboard (1W)](/?tf=1w)
- **4h**: practical execution timeframe  
  Open: [Dashboard (4h)](/?tf=4h)

This combo is slower but tends to avoid “random” trades.

## Combo #4 (Stability filter): 12h bias + 30m timing

If 4h is too reactive in your market conditions:

- **12h**: smoother bias  
  Open: [Dashboard (12h)](/?tf=12h)
- **30m**: timing without micro-noise  
  Open: [Dashboard (30m)](/?tf=30m)

This often works well in choppy weeks when the 5m/15m flips frequently.

## A simple decision tree

Use this when you’re unsure:

1) Is 5m messy? → Use 15m or 30m for timing  
2) Is 4h flipping? → Use 12h for bias  
3) Is everything compressed (no spread)? → Stand aside or wait for a new session

## What “alignment” actually looks like

Alignment doesn’t mean “everything is identical”.

It means:

- The same currencies tend to stay in the top and bottom groups
- Strength doesn’t reverse every few minutes
- The spread between top and bottom isn’t tiny

If alignment disappears, you’re likely in consolidation or transition.

## Next step: add currency context

Once you have a timeframe combo, add currency-specific context (behavior, typical drivers, common pairs):

- [Currencies](/currencies)
- Example: [USD strength](/currencies/usd)
- Example: [JPY strength](/currencies/jpy)
