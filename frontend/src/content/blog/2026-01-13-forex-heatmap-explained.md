A **forex heatmap** answers a simple question:

> Which FX pairs are actually moving right now — and on which timeframes?

If you already use a currency strength meter, the heatmap is the perfect companion:

- **Strength** = who’s strong vs weak
- **Heatmap** = which pairs are *moving* (momentum / volatility confirmation)

Open the live heatmap here: [Forex heatmap](/heatmap).

## What you’re looking at

On LiveForexStrength, the heatmap shows:

- rows = major pairs (and key crosses)
- columns = timeframes (5m → 1W)
- values = **pips** or **percent change**

The color is directional:

- green = up move
- red = down move
- pale/neutral = little movement (often range / low conviction)

## The #1 reading mistake: chasing the 5m column

If you only scan the 5m column, you’ll chase noise.

Instead:

1) start from **4h / 12h / 1W** to understand the broader move
2) confirm the move still exists on **1h / 30m**
3) use **15m / 5m** as timing only

Timeframes guide: [Timeframes](/timeframes).

## A fast scanning method (30 seconds)

1) Pick your timeframe column (start with **4h**).  
2) Find the top 3 movers by absolute size (biggest |pips| or |%|).  
3) Check if those same pairs still show direction on **1h** and **15m**.

When direction “stacks” across timeframes, the move is usually cleaner than a single-timeframe spike.

## Combine heatmap with strength (the cleanest workflow)

The best setup is when both agree:

1) Strength meter shows a clear **top vs bottom** currency split  
2) Heatmap confirms the related pair is **moving** on multiple timeframes

## Use pairs pages for context (avoid “random” picks)

Once the heatmap highlights a mover, jump to the pair page:

- [Browse pairs](/pairs)

Those pages help you frame the move in “base vs quote” terms and link to the relevant currency pages.

## When the heatmap is *not* useful

The heatmap loses value when:

- everything is near zero (low volatility)
- timeframes disagree strongly (transition / session change)
- a single candle dominates (news spike without follow-through)

In those situations, zoom out, or wait.
