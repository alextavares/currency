A **currency strength meter** is a tool that ranks currencies (like USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CHF, CAD, AUD, NZD) from **strongest to weakest** over a selected timeframe. Instead of staring at one pair at a time, you get a bird’s‑eye view of the whole FX “basket”.

If you’re using **LiveForexStrength**, open the live dashboard here: [Dashboard](/).

## What it measures (in plain English)

Currencies don’t have an absolute price. They only move **relative** to other currencies through pairs (EURUSD, GBPJPY, etc.). A strength meter summarizes those relative moves and answers:

- Which currency is currently **leading** the basket?
- Which currency is currently **lagging** the basket?
- Are those rankings consistent across timeframes (e.g., 4h bias + 15m timing)?

On LiveForexStrength, the score is normalized to a **0–100** range, so you can compare currencies quickly.

## What it does NOT measure

This is where most people get it wrong. A strength meter is *not*:

- a trade signal by itself
- a prediction tool
- a replacement for risk management or market context (news, sessions, liquidity)

It is a **filter**. It helps you focus on **strong-vs-weak** opportunities and ignore random pairs that are just chopping.

## Why “strong vs weak” matters

Most clean trends come from pairing:

- a **strong** currency (ranked near the top)
- with a **weak** currency (ranked near the bottom)

For example:

- If **USD is strong** and **JPY is weak**, pairs like **USDJPY** may trend more cleanly than random combinations.
- If **EUR is weak** and **CHF is strong**, **EURCHF** may have a directional bias.

You can explore each currency’s typical behavior here: [Currencies](/currencies).

## A practical workflow (bias → timing)

Use multiple timeframes to avoid false starts:

1) **Bias timeframe**: start on [4h](/timeframes/4h), [12h](/timeframes/12h), or [1W](/timeframes/1w)  
2) **Context timeframe**: use [1h](/timeframes/1h) to align with sessions and structure  
3) **Timing timeframe**: use [15m](/timeframes/15m) or [5m](/timeframes/5m) for entries

If you want the dashboard preselected to a timeframe, you can open it like this:

- Weekly view: [Dashboard (1W)](/?tf=1w)
- 4-hour view: [Dashboard (4h)](/?tf=4h)
- 15-minute view: [Dashboard (15m)](/?tf=15m)

## Common mistakes (and how to avoid them)

### 1) Trading the top currency against a “middle” currency
If the second currency isn’t weak, the move can stall. Prefer **top vs bottom** combinations first.

### 2) Ignoring higher timeframes
If 1W says “USD strong” but 5m says “USD weak”, you might be looking at a short-term pullback. Decide which timeframe you’re actually trading.

### 3) Treating the score as a magic number
Scores are best interpreted as **rankings**, not as absolute guarantees. “Strong” means “stronger than the rest” over that timeframe.
