The **London session** often brings the first sustained liquidity of the day — which is why many strength-based moves show up there.

But it also produces false starts (especially around the open).

Use:

- [Dashboard](/)
- [Heatmap](/heatmap)

## A simple London workflow

1) Before London, check bias on 4h/12h (who is strong/weak).  
2) At/after the open, use 1h for context (structure + direction).  
3) Use 15m for timing after the first volatility burst settles.  
4) Confirm movers on the heatmap (avoid dead pairs).

Quick links:

- [Dashboard (12h)](/?tf=12h)
- [Dashboard (1h)](/?tf=1h)
- [Dashboard (15m)](/?tf=15m)

## What usually causes London “fake” signals

- compressed basket before the open (no spread)
- 5m flips from initial volatility
- timeframes disagree (transition)

## Use the heatmap to confirm continuation

The best London moves usually show:

- direction on 4h/1h
- movement on 1h/30m/15m heatmap columns

Tool:

- [Heatmap](/heatmap)
